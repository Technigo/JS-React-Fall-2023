      Let's use some DOM manipulation to target the div container element with
      the class of "box" and through some DOM manipulation lets change the
      background color of this element once the user selects a theme from the
      theme options.

      If you're up for a bit of an extra challenge, you can take this exercise
      to the next level by adding a super smooth transition effect to the color
      changes. This is like adding a touch of magic! 😊 So, building on what
      you've done so far, you can introduce a special CSS class called
      .color-transition that makes the color change really smooth. When you pick
      a theme, your JavaScript can make this class pop onto the .box element,
      triggering that fancy transition you're aiming for. And guess what? After
      a tiny pause, you can make the class disappear, making sure the smoothness
      is just where you want it. It's like giving your project a stylish
      makeover and showing off your knack for using advanced CSS tricks and
      making the DOM dance a little.
