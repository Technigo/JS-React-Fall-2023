/*
1) (This has a DEMO solution.)
Create a variable that stores the name of your cafe.
Print out a greeting such as "Welcome to Technigo Cafe! What would you like to order today?"
Where Technigo Cafe is replaced by the name of your cafe that is stored in the variable.
*/

const cafeName = "Technigo Cafe";
console.log(`Welcome to ${cafeName}! What would you like to order today?`);

/*

*/
// Good practice Approach

// Bad practive Approach

/*
3)
Create a variable that stores a boolean.

*/

/*
4)

*/

/*

Assign it a value.
Print it out.
assign it a new value.
Print it out. => This should give you an error because it shouldn't be able to be changed.
*/

//maxGuests = "I also love rock n roll!";
/*
6)
Create a variable that stores a string.
Print out that string in only UPPERCASE letters.
*/

/*
7)
Print out the same string in only lowercase letters.
*/

/*
8) **BONUS**
