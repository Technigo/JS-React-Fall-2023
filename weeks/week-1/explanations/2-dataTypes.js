// Data Types

// There are different types of data that we can use in a JavaScript.

// To be clear there are 2 types of data cagegories:
// - Primitive Data Types
// - Non-Primitive Data Types

// In simple terms, primitive data types represent only one value while non primitive data types are the collections of primitive data types

// Primitive Data Types:
// Strings - Represents textual data
// Number - An integer or a floating-point number
// BigInt - An integer with arbitrary precision - is a special type of number that allows you to work with really, really big whole numbers.
// Boolean - Any of two values: true or false
// Undefined - A data type whose variable is not defined or initialized
// Null -  A null value

// Non Primitive Data Types:
// Arrays - Container of multiples values of collection of data
// Objects - Container with key-value pairs of collection of data

// IMPORTANT!!!!
// The typeof operator returns a string indicating the type of the operand's value || the data type that is used.
// Is like a detective that helps you figure out what type of thing something is. It tells you if something is a number, a word, a function, or something else. It's like looking at an object and saying, "Hey, what are you?" to understand what kind of thing you're dealing with in your code.
